*Embedded friendly `std::function` alternative. The usage method is consistent with `std::function`.*

## Overview

- ✅ **Easy to use**
  
  The `embed::function` is used in the same way as `std::function`.

  We also provide `embed::make_function` to automatically deduce the template type.

- ✅ **No dynamic memory allocation**

  Never allocates memory on the heap. Ensure the real-time performance of the code.

- ✅ **Adjustable buffer size**

  Users can specify the buffer size used by each embed::function instance, which is used to wrap callable objects of different sizes.

  The default value of buffer size `FnDefaultBufSize` is defined at the beginning of the embed_function.hpp header file, and it is set to the size of one pointer. Users can customize this value.

- ✅ **Extremely minimal memory usage**

  By default, it occupies 2 pointer-sized(manager + buffer) amounts of RAM.

  If you need to package larger callable objects, you can manually adjust the buffer size of the `embed::function<Signature, BufSize>`.

- ✅ **Environmentally friendly for disabling exceptions**

  The `embed::function` itself supports both enabling and disabling of exceptions, but it is more recommended to use it in the mode where exceptions are disabled.

  When exceptions are disabled, calling an empty `embed::function` instance by the user will invoke the `bad_function_call_handler` function for processing (by default, it simply terminates the program), and the logic of the `bad_function_call_handler` function is at the beginning of the embed_function.hpp file. Users can customize it.

- ✅ **Support non-copyable objects**

  According to the C++ proposal [N4159](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4159.pdf), the `embed::function` class, in addition to supporting the basic functions of `std::function`, also adds support for non-copyable objects.

  When a user attempts to perform a copy operation (copy constructor, copy assignment, etc) on an `embed::function` instance that is wrapped with an uncopyable type, the program will call the `bad_function_copy_handler` function (which defaults to terminating the program). The `bad_function_copy_handler` function is located at the beginning of embed_function.hpp and is customizable.

## Quick start

- Clone the repo.
- Add include path <repo_root>/include
- In program `#include "embed/embed_function.hpp"`
- Use the `embed::function` template class.

```cpp
#include "embed/embed_function.hpp"

struct Example {
    static void staticFkn(int) {};
    void memberFkn(int) {};
    void operator()(int) {};
};

int main() 
{
    Example e;

    // Here, the second template parameter can be omitted.
    // Same as: embed::function<void(int)> fn;
    embed::function<void(int), sizeof(void*)> fn;

    fn = [&e](int p) { e.memberFkn(p); };
    fn(123);

    fn = &Example::staticFkn;
    fn(456);

    fn = e;
    fn(789);

    // The type of auto_fn is 
    // embed::function<void(Example&,int), sizeof(&Example::memberFkn)>
    auto auto_fn = embed::make_function(&Example::memberFkn);
    auto_fn(e, 101112);
}

```

## Design goals driving the design

  - Should behave close to a normal function pointer. Small, efficient, no heap allocation.

  - Should be used in a manner similar to `std::function`, being able to truly "wrap" callable objects and manage their lifetimes.

  - Support the packaging of all callable objects in C++, including:
    - Free function.
    - Lambda function.
    - Functor.
    - Static member function.
    - Member function. (should be wrapped by lambda function)

  - Be usable with C++11 while offering more functionality for later editions.
    - C++11 provides most of the functionality.
    - C++17 introduces a template type deduction guide, allowing users to use the underlying type `embed::Fn` (where `embed::function` is an alias for `embed::Fn`) without having to specify the template parameters.

  - Be constexpr and exception friendly. As much as possible should be declared constexpr and noexcept.

## Solution without the C++ standard library

  In some embedded situations, the compiler may not support the standard libraries of C++, such as &lt;type_traits&gt;, &lt;new&gt;, and so on. Therefore, we provide [`embed_function_nostd.hpp`](./include/embed/embed_function_nostd.hpp) as a solution. This file implements all the standard library contents required by this project. Users only need to define the macro **`EMBED_NO_STD_HEADER`** during compilation to enable it.

## Tests

  The test cases have been provided in the [test](./test/) directory. Refer to the commands in the [test/ReadMe](./test/ReadMe.md) file for testing.
